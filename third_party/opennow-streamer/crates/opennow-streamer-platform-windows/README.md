# OpenNOW Windows media backend

This isolated crate provides the Windows media end of the native streamer. It accepts complete
H.264, HEVC/H.265, or AV1 access units and interleaved `f32` PCM that has already been decoded from
Opus.

The backend uses only Windows system APIs:

- Media Foundation hardware MFTs for H.264/HEVC/AV1 decode into NV12/P010, or AYUV/Y410 when the
  installed decoder exposes those exact formats. Hardware selection checks the selected adapter's
  DXVA profile, output format, and decoder configuration before trying adapter-matched transforms
  and D3D11-aware registered MFTs. A separate software mode accepts only
  synchronous/asynchronous software MFTs that are D3D11-aware and publish D3D11-backed output;
  the two modes are never silently mixed.
- A D3D11 video processor and a two-buffer flip-model DXGI swap chain for NV12 conversion, aspect-correct scaling, and presentation. The swap chain can target a caller-owned HWND, or the backend can create and own a child or top-level HWND.
- WASAPI shared-mode rendering for interleaved IEEE-float PCM. Windows performs endpoint format conversion when the active mix format differs.

`WindowsBackend::probe_for` accepts an explicit `Option<WindowsAdapterLuid>` and creates a hidden
presentation path using either D3D11 or a D3D12-backed D3D11-on-12 device. `None` preserves the
system default; `Some` resolves that exact DXGI adapter and fails without a default-adapter retry
when it is unavailable. The probe independently checks adapter-matched hardware transforms and registered
software transforms for H.264, HEVC and AV1, and starts a 48 kHz stereo WASAPI client. A codec
capability is reported only when its selected decoder class and the complete presentation/audio
operation succeed. `WindowsBackend::probe` remains the D3D11 compatibility entry point.
Non-Windows builds expose the same typed API but report the backend as unavailable.

`CapabilityProbe.h265_hdr`, `av1_hdr`, and `supports_hdr(codec)` report HDR separately from
SDR codec support. `h265_10bit`, `av1_10bit`, `h265_444`, `h265_10bit_444`, and
`supports_format(codec, pixel_format, hdr)` distinguish each supported depth/chroma combination.
Advanced-format probes decode a synthetic 1920x1080 access unit through the selected MFT,
require a D3D11-backed output frame preserving the requested depth, chroma, and transfer,
then execute the embedded converter: `VideoProcessorBlt` for P010/HDR and a UINT shader for
SDR Y410. Both paths produce the actual RGB10A2 texture used by Qt.
An exposed media subtype or provisional startup format alone is not a successful probe.
The fixtures and their generation/verification commands are in `fixtures/probe/`.
These checks use the exact optional adapter passed to `probe_for`;
the Qt-adopted device is checked independently when its decoder and converter are created.
The capability probe does not establish that a monitor or the Qt swapchain supports HDR.
Decoded-output polling is bounded to 500 ms per advanced profile, at most three seconds per
graphics API, excluding Windows API call latency. Results are reused for the same adapter LUID
and D3D API; device removal or an adapter change invalidates them. Timeouts are not cached.
Presentation and audio are always checked again. Live session creation independently validates
the adopted Qt device and actual output, so cached capabilities cannot authorize a downgraded frame.
Installing a different decoder requires restarting the process to refresh cached MFT failures.

## Embedded HDR color contract

`VideoFormat` carries explicit transfer function, primaries, matrix, range, and chroma siting.
Callers supply the negotiated defaults, including `VideoChromaSiting::Left` for GFN. Actual
Media Foundation output metadata overrides these defaults; unsupported metadata and HDR-to-SDR
decoder downgrades fail rather than being mislabeled. HDR requires ten-bit BT.2020 output;
ten-bit SDR remains SDR. Color-only changes invalidate converter resources and texture slots.

The embedded renderer publishes `D3d11RecordedFrame` with `texture_format: Rgb10A2` and
`color_space: Pq2020` for HDR. PQ uses the matching LEFT or TOPLEFT input colorspace. HLG can
convert to PQ only for TOPLEFT siting and explicit driver support; HLG with LEFT siting and
full-range PQ fail because no exact DXGI input colorspace is available. SDR uses BT.709 RGB,
with RGBA8 for eight-bit input and RGB10A2 for ten-bit input.
For packed 4:4:4, chroma exists at every luma pixel, so LEFT and TOPLEFT do not describe different
sample positions. The converter selects an available DXGI siting label without resampling chroma;
4:2:0 still requires its exact negotiated siting.
The standalone HWND presenter explicitly rejects HDR; HDR presentation belongs to the embedded
Qt path, which must preserve the recorded texture's color interpretation through scan-out.
When the host configured an explicit adapter LUID, the FFI verifies that the borrowed Qt D3D11
device reports the same DXGI adapter before installing the graphics context. A mismatch fails
explicitly; it cannot authorize decode using capabilities from a different default adapter.
## Embedded Qt SDR conversion

The embedded frame producer converts NV12/AYUV to RGBA8 and P010/Y410 to RGB10A2,
preserving ten-bit precision until Qt's final SDR composition pass. RGB10A2 is an SDR
intermediate, not an HDR or ten-bit scan-out guarantee. Both full- and limited-range
BT.709 decoder output are converted to full-range BT.709 RGB.

Embedded conversion requires `ID3D11VideoContext1` for explicit color-space selection and
`ID3D11VideoProcessorEnumerator1` to validate the input/output format and color-space pair.
Unsupported conversions fail explicitly; the producer does not silently replace RGB10A2
with RGBA8 or rely on legacy driver color defaults. Format, range, and extent changes
invalidate the processor, cached input views, and frame slots before conversion resumes.

Media Foundation may temporarily negotiate a lower-precision output type before reading
the first sequence header. That startup compatibility does not permit downgraded frames:
each decoded surface must match its output media type and preserve at least the negotiated
bit depth and chroma before entering the decoded queue.
Provisional startup metadata is not validated as an actual HDR frame before the sequence header
arrives. The first actual sample and every output-type change undergo strict validation, including
HDR color metadata; lower-precision frames never reach conversion.

## Exact SDR Y410 conversion

On the validated RTX3080 driver, the video processor preserved all decoded Y410 values but
applied eight-bit-normalized nominal-range/chroma offsets during RGB conversion. A neutral
10-bit white became R1017/G1021/B1016 instead of 1023, and disabling automatic processing
made no difference. The decoded surface itself was sample-exact.

SDR BT.709 Y410 therefore uses a deterministic GPU shader: one GPU copy crops the decoded
array slice into a sampleable Y410 texture, a UINT view exposes the exact ten-bit U/Y/V codes,
and explicit full/limited-range matrix math writes RGB10A2. The input texture and visited Qt
output slots are bounded and reused. A deferred command list restores Qt's immediate-context
state; format/range/extent changes recreate converter resources. Unsupported views or formats
fail explicitly, with no CPU download or lower-precision fallback.

P010/PQ HDR retains the video processor. A valid Main10 PQ ramp was checked against a software
decoder reference and preserved 875 RGB10A2/PQ gray levels within two code values across three
decoder recreations on the same RTX3080. This verifies the encoded color pipeline, not monitor
scan-out or optical HDR accuracy. Shader compilation uses Windows' system D3DCompiler 47.

## HEVC availability in Qt

The embedded Qt stream view uses the same Media Foundation decoder configuration as the
Windows capability probe. HEVC input types explicitly carry the profile matching the negotiated
bit depth and chroma before the decoder selects its output type. Hardware profile checks and
D3D11 surface requirements still apply; setting a profile does not enable an unsupported GPU.

Windows must have a registered, activatable HEVC Media Foundation decoder, such as Microsoft's
HEVC Video Extensions, in addition to a compatible GPU and driver. The app does not bundle a
separate Windows HEVC decoder. An installed extension alone does not prove that decoder
activation or D3D11 configuration succeeds.

Microsoft's older [HEVC decoder documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/medfound/h-265---hevc-video-decoder)
lists Main/Main10 4:2:0 and NV12/P010, but that is not an exhaustive description of current
HEVCVideoExtension MFTs. On an RTX3080 with driver 32.0.16.1047, the D3D11 path decoded actual
AYUV and Main44410/Y410 access units and completed embedded conversion; the same device's
D3D12-backed path rejected 4:4:4. Main44410 initially negotiated provisional NV12 before
producing Y410 after the sequence header. Runtime probing of the selected API, GPU, installed
MFT, actual decoded texture, and converter is authoritative; neither old documentation nor
a GPU model name alone establishes support. Unsupported combinations report their failure stage.
AV1 4:4:4 and HDR 4:4:4 are not advertised. No alternative FFmpeg or NVDEC decoder is bundled.

When Qt disables H.265, `%APPDATA%\OpenNOW\diagnostics\native-streamer.log` records
`Windows hardware decoder probe failed` with `codec=H.265` and the decoder error, even if H.264
remains available. `OPENNOW_DATA_DIR` overrides the data directory. Configuration failures include
the MFT name and activation, D3D manager, or input-type stage where applicable.

## Integration API

```rust,no_run
use std::num::NonZeroU32;
use opennow_streamer_platform_windows::{
    AudioFormat, BackendConfig, Bounds, OwnedWindow, SurfaceTarget, VideoCodec, VideoFormat,
    VideoChromaFormat, VideoChromaSiting, VideoPixelFormat, VideoTransferFunction,
    VideoColorPrimaries, VideoColorMatrix, WindowsBackend,
};

let backend = WindowsBackend::start(BackendConfig {
    video: VideoFormat {
        codec: VideoCodec::H264,
        width: 1920,
        height: 1080,
        frame_rate_numerator: NonZeroU32::new(120).unwrap(),

    },

        channels: 2,
    },
    surface: SurfaceTarget::Owned(OwnedWindow {
        parent: None,
        bounds: Bounds {
            x: 0,
            y: 0,
            width: 1920,
            height: 1080,
        },
        visible: true,
    }),
    video_queue_capacity: 3,
    audio_queue_capacity: 8,
})?;
# Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
```

`submit_video` and `submit_audio` never wait for the media thread. When a configured queue is full, the oldest packet is discarded and the method returns `PushOutcome::DroppedOldest`. The WASAPI staging buffer is independently capped at two endpoint buffers. Events use a bounded drop-oldest queue as well, so a stalled event consumer cannot create unbounded memory growth.

### Existing and parented surfaces

`SurfaceTarget::Existing` is only for a dedicated HWND that the caller reserves for D3D presentation. Do not pass the shell's interactive top-level HWND as an existing surface because the swap chain and window input policy would then share that interactive window.

An embedded shell integration must use `SurfaceTarget::Owned` with the shell HWND in `OwnedWindow::parent`. The backend creates a child with `WS_EX_NOACTIVATE | WS_EX_TRANSPARENT`, returns `HTTRANSPARENT` from `WM_NCHITTEST`, and rejects mouse activation. The child therefore cannot take focus or consume pointer input from the shell. `OwnedWindow::bounds` are parent-client coordinates relative to the shell. Calling `set_surface` with the same parent updates those bounds and `visible` state in place with `SWP_NOACTIVATE`; changing the parent recreates the owned child and its swap chain.

Video and audio reconfiguration flush their respective queues. D3D11 or WASAPI failures move the backend to `Recovering`, clear stale packets, and retry for five seconds. Successful D3D recovery emits `KeyFrameRequired`; exhausted recovery emits a fatal device-loss event. `stop` closes both queues and joins the media thread, including when recovery is in progress.

## Checks

The crate is a member of the native streamer workspace and can also be checked directly:

```sh
cargo test --manifest-path native/opennow-streamer/crates/opennow-streamer-platform-windows/Cargo.toml
cargo check --manifest-path native/opennow-streamer/crates/opennow-streamer-platform-windows/Cargo.toml --all-targets --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
cargo check --manifest-path native/opennow-streamer/crates/opennow-streamer-platform-windows/Cargo.toml --all-targets --target aarch64-pc-windows-msvc
cargo run --manifest-path native/opennow-streamer/crates/opennow-streamer-platform-windows/Cargo.toml --example probe
```

On a Windows GPU machine, the example prints D3D11 and D3D12-backed capability results and the
specific failures for unsupported profiles. The Windows-only unit tests exercise Media Foundation
metadata and D3D11 processing; cross-target `cargo check` compiles but does not execute them.

The explicit hardware precision regression decodes a lossless Main44410/RExt fixture, checks
the actual Y410 decoder surface, converts it through the embedded GPU converter, and reads
back the test-only RGB10A2 target. It verifies at least 800 distinct gray levels, every sample
of an 877-level gray ramp, and 1920 alternating one-pixel chroma samples across three decoder
restarts. It has no unsupported-hardware skip once explicitly selected:

```sh
cargo test --manifest-path native/opennow-streamer/Cargo.toml -p opennow-streamer-platform-windows hevc_444_hardware_decode_and_conversion_preserve_precision_and_chroma -- --ignored --nocapture --test-threads=1
```

The cross-target checks validate the Win32 bindings for x64 and ARM64. Hardware decode, presentation, audio output, device removal, and endpoint switching still require tests on real Windows hardware.

The corresponding HDR precision regression uses a valid Main10/PQ fixture and a committed
software-decoded luma reference. It keeps the same two-code conversion tolerance rather than
folding codec errors into a wider tolerance:

```sh
cargo test --manifest-path native/opennow-streamer/Cargo.toml -p opennow-streamer-platform-windows hevc_hdr_hardware_decode_and_conversion_preserve_pq_precision -- --ignored --nocapture --test-threads=1
```
